# Challenge 6: Break repeating-key XOR
It is officially on, now.

This challenge isn't conceptually hard, but it involves actual error-prone coding. The other challenges in this set are there to bring you up to speed. This one is there to qualify you. If you can do this one, you're probably just fine up to Set 6.

There's a file here. It's been base64'd after being encrypted with repeating-key XOR.

Decrypt it.

Here's how:

    Let KEYSIZE be the guessed length of the key; try values from 2 to (say) 40.
    Write a function to compute the edit distance/Hamming distance between two strings. The Hamming distance is just the number of differing bits. The distance between:

    this is a test

    and

    wokka wokka!!!

    is 37. Make sure your code agrees before you proceed.
    For each KEYSIZE, take the first KEYSIZE worth of bytes, and the second KEYSIZE worth of bytes, and find the edit distance between them. Normalize this result by dividing by KEYSIZE.
    The KEYSIZE with the smallest normalized edit distance is probably the key. You could proceed perhaps with the smallest 2-3 KEYSIZE values. Or take 4 KEYSIZE blocks instead of 2 and average the distances.
    Now that you probably know the KEYSIZE: break the ciphertext into blocks of KEYSIZE length.
    Now transpose the blocks: make a block that is the first byte of every block, and a block that is the second byte of every block, and so on.
    Solve each block as if it was single-character XOR. You already have code to do this.
    For each block, the single-byte XOR key that produces the best looking histogram is the repeating-key XOR key byte for that block. Put them together and you have the key.
    
    
# Challenge 9: Implement PKCS#7 padding

A block cipher transforms a fixed-sized block (usually 8 or 16 bytes) of plaintext into ciphertext. But we almost never want to transform a single block; we encrypt irregularly-sized messages.

One way we account for irregularly-sized messages is by padding, creating a plaintext that is an even multiple of the blocksize. The most popular padding scheme is called PKCS#7.

So: pad any block to a specific block length, by appending the number of bytes of padding to the end of the block. For instance,

"YELLOW SUBMARINE"

... padded to 20 bytes would be:

"YELLOW SUBMARINE\x04\x04\x04\x04"



This code is going to turn out to be surprisingly useful later on. Breaking repeating-key XOR ("Vigenere") statistically is obviously an academic exercise, a "Crypto 101" thing. But more people "know how" to break it than can actually break it, and a similar technique breaks something much more important. 

# Challenge 7: AES in ECB mode

The Base64-encoded content in this file has been encrypted via AES-128 in ECB mode under the key

"YELLOW SUBMARINE".

(case-sensitive, without the quotes; exactly 16 characters; I like "YELLOW SUBMARINE" because it's exactly 16 bytes long, and now you do too).

Decrypt it. You know the key, after all.

Easiest way: use OpenSSL::Cipher and give it AES-128-ECB as the cipher. 


# Challenge 8: Detect AES in ECB mode

In the provided file are a bunch of hex-encoded ciphertexts.

One of them has been encrypted with ECB.

Detect it.

Remember that the problem with ECB is that it is stateless and deterministic; the same 16 byte plaintext block will always produce the same 16 byte ciphertext.


# Challenge 10: Implement CBC mode

CBC mode is a block cipher mode that allows us to encrypt irregularly-sized messages, despite the fact that a block cipher natively only transforms individual blocks.

In CBC mode, each ciphertext block is added to the next plaintext block before the next call to the cipher core.

The first plaintext block, which has no associated previous ciphertext block, is added to a "fake 0th ciphertext block" called the initialization vector, or IV.

Implement CBC mode by hand by taking the ECB function you wrote earlier, making it encrypt instead of decrypt (verify this by decrypting whatever you encrypt to test), and using your XOR function from the previous exercise to combine them.

The file here is intelligible (somewhat) when CBC decrypted against "YELLOW SUBMARINE" with an IV of all ASCII 0 (\x00\x00\x00 &c)
Don't cheat.

Do not use OpenSSL's CBC code to do CBC mode, even to verify your results. What's the point of even doing this stuff if you aren't going to learn from it?
